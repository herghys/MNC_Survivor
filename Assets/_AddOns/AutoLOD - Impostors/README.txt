Welcome on AutoLOD - Impostors

A pipeline solver window will open automatically after import to help you finish the setup.
If not - or if you accidentally closed the window - reimport the AutoLOD.UNINITIALIZED file. Note that this file will be deleted after the setup is complete.

Only Legacy and Universal render pipelines are fully supported, but you can use the HDRP Toolkit to use impostors baked with a URP project in an HDRP project.
You can download it from this link : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bwT4uMsH9o3AepEdnPYujVQIhPFmJ8mt/view?usp=sharing

A demo scene is available in the Demo folder.
To get started, just click on "Window->AutoLOD->Impostors"

A documentation is available online. Please click on "Window->AutoLOD->Impostors Documentation" to open it.

If you are having troubles with the asset please send an e-mail to chaumartinleo@gmail.com, I will be glad to help.

Have fun!
